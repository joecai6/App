To-do

- Enable VT-x (Vitrualization technology extension) in BIOS /

- Work on app functionality
	- add weights for percentages and find formula for grading

- Plan / Design front end

Vt-x
- Intel technology for virtualization on x86, virtual machine extension

x86
- x86 instruction achitecture 64 bit ISA (instruction set architection) which is machine language to the processor, assembly commands
 	- called x86 because of 8086 intel microprocessor in 1976
- ARM is a RISC (Reduced Instrution Set Computing) more general instructions using registers to load/store
- x86 is a CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) single instruction doing complex things where it would take multiple commands from RISC architecture

64-bit
- 64 bit processors can reference much more memory than 32 bits because 2^64 which allows processors to have multiple cores, faster calculations
- length of words (units) in the instructon set, number of bits being processed at a time, more locations to access so more memory
